# Hardware

The main challenge is to incorporate the RFID reader into the USB-C port, while keeping the charging functionality present. Therefore, the necessary condition for the tablet is to have additional charging capability â€“ usually this is connected with the presence of a charging stand/docking station (pogo pin pads on the side).  

Due to increased durability (and the ability to hide the RFID module), the tablet was put into the EVA foam cover. Unfortunately, this render of the shelf tablet stand is unusable. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer the tablet stand electronics into a 3D printed custom stand.
